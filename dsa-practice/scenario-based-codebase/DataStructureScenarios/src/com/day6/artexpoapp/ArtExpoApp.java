/*
9. ArtExpo – Sort Artists by Registration Time (Insertion Sort)
Story: 
	● At an art exhibition, artists register throughout the day. 
	● The system continuously adds each entry and maintains a sorted list by registration time for booth assignment. 
	● Insertion Sort fits well due to the incremental nature.
Key Concepts:
	● Real-time insertion
	● Nearly sorted data
	● Time-based ordering
