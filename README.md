```
- Studied basics of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).
- Learned why DSA is used in modern applications.

### 🗓 Day 15 – Linked List
**(Date: 02-Jan-2026)**

- Studied Linked List and its basic concept
  - `Node structure` (data + next reference)
  - `Dynamic memory` allocation
- Types of Linked Lists:
  - `Singly` Linked List
  - `Doubly` Linked List
  - `Circular` Linked List
- Operations performed on Linked List:
  - `Insertion` (beginning, end, position)
  - `Deletion` (by value / position)
  - `Traversal`
  - `Searching elements`
- Advantages and limitations of Linked List
  - Dynamic size
  - No direct access, sequential traversal
- Implemented Linked List programs in Java
- Committed and pushed all work

 ### 🗓 Day 16 – Stacks, Queues, HashMap & Hash Functions
**(Date: 03-Jan-2026)**

- Studied `Stack` (LIFO) and `Queue` (FIFO) concepts.
- Learned basic operations: `push`, `pop`, `peek`, `offer`, `poll`.
- Implemented stack problems and queue problems.
- Studied HashMap and hashing basics (`put`, `get`, collisions).
- Implemented HashMap and hash function concepts.
- Committed and pushed all work.

### 🗓 Day 17 – Sorting Algorithms
**(Date: 05-Jan-2026)**

- Studied the concept of sorting and its importance in data organization
- Learned and understood the working of:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort (Divide and Conquer)
  - Quick Sort (Divide and Conquer)
- Analyzed time and space complexity, stability, and use cases of each sorting algorithm
- Understood comparison-based vs non-comparison-based sorting
- Explored additional sorting algorithms:
  - Selection Sort
  - Heap Sort
  - Counting Sort
  - Radix Sort
  - Bucket Sort
- Implemented sorting algorithms in Java
- Committed and pushed all work
